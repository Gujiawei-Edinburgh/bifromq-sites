# BifroMQ Community

As an open-source project, BifroMQ warmly welcomes developers and enterprises to actively participate in project development and enhancement. To facilitate this, we have provided an abundance of resources such as documentation, tutorials, Q&A, and code contributions on the BifroMQ official website ([https://bifromq.io/](https://bifromq.io/)) and the GitHub community platform ([https://github.com/apache/bifromq](https://github.com/apache/bifromq)). 

Additionally, you can also join our <a href="https://discord.gg/Pfs3QRadRB">Discord group</a>.
